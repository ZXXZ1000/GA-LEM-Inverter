# GA-LEM-Inverter
This repository contains the implementation of a GA-based inversion method for deciphering tectonic uplift fields from landscape topography. Features include coupling with the Fastscape LEM, a multi-dimensional fitness function with perceptual similarity (LPIPS), and dimensionality reduction. See accompanying paper: [In Submission].
